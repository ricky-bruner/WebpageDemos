## Tranfigure.io

For this project, I have decided to build a webpage that features many attempts to create quality webpage elements that utilize areas of CSS that I am less familar with. Most of the components will be my build version of many videos from the youtube channel [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog). I can not recommend this channel enough on youtube, especially if you are curious about styling or want to gain exposure to areas of CSS that you may be less familiar with.
